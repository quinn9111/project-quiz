## Take a interavtive quiz to test your skills!
This quiz app was created utilizing two API's. One was for presenting the user with questions and answers on a random quiz subject.The other was used to generate random facts that change every ten seconds displayed on the bottom of the screen.
When the user finishes a quiz, their score is displayed at the end, based on the amount they got right or wrong.
If the user decides to take another quiz, a new random quiz with new questions and answers will be given.
